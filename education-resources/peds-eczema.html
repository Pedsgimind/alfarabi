        <p>
          This page is part of the Al Farabi Gastroenterology &amp; Endoscopy Centre patient and family
          education library. It is written in general language and is not a substitute for advice
          from your own doctor.

        <h2>What is Eczema?</h2>
        <p>
          Eczema is a medical condition that can affect your health and quality of life.
          The exact cause, symptoms, and treatment can vary from person to person. Your healthcare
          team will explain how this condition applies to you or your child.
        </p>

        <h2>Common symptoms</h2>
        <p>
          People may experience different symptoms. Some common features of Eczema can include
          discomfort, changes in usual body habits, or test results that are not normal. Always tell
          your doctor about any new or worsening symptoms.
        </p>

        <h2>How is it diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>
          Diagnosis usually starts with a careful history and physical examination. Depending on the
          condition, your doctor may recommend blood tests, stool tests, imaging, or endoscopy. The
          exact plan will be individualized for you or your child.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment and management</h2>
        <p>
          Treatment may include lifestyle changes, medicines, procedures, or surgery. Your care team
          will discuss the benefits, possible side effects, and goals of treatment. Never stop or
          change medications without checking with your doctor.
        </p>

        <h2>When to seek urgent help</h2>
        <p>
          Go to the nearest emergency department or seek urgent medical care if you or your child
          develops severe pain, vomiting, trouble breathing, high fever, bleeding, confusion, or any
          symptom that worries you.
